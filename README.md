# Transformer Neural Network

Transformer Neural Network, a deep learning model which brought revolution in the field of Natural Language Processing since its introduction in 2017. It introduced the concept of self-attention, allowing the model to capture global dependencies efficiently. Here we will implement the transformer neural network for a small dataset. Our goal is not to implement the algorithm efficiently rather to understand the inner working mechanism.
